"readonly" is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This project aims to create an online bookstore where users can browse books, view details about them, and make purchases. The application will include features such as user authentication and authorization, a catalog with search and filtering functionalities, a shopping cart, and secure checkout processes. Admin users will have additional functionalities such as adding new books, updating book details, and managing orders. The goal of "readonly" is to provide a seamless and enjoyable online shopping experience for book enthusiasts.
